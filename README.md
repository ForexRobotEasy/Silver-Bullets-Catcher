## Description

The Silver Bullets Catcher is an Expert Advisor (EA) that trades based on the signals generated by a custom indicator called 'Silver Bullet'. The EA identifies profitable positions and closes them, and also opens new positions when a silver bullet signal is detected.

## Dependencies

To use this code, you need to include the following libraries and modules:

- Trade.mqh
- Timeseries.mqh

## Constants and Variables

- `TICKET`: An integer variable to store the ticket number of a position.
- `stopLoss`: A double variable to set the stop loss level for new positions.
- `takeProfit`: A double variable to set the take profit level for new positions.
- `lotSize`: A double variable to set the lot size for new positions.
- `trade`: An instance of the CTrade class to handle trading operations.
- `series`: An instance of the CTimeseries class to handle time series data.

## Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the EA. In this function, the trade module is initialized by setting the expert magic number and deviation in pips. The timeseries module is also initialized by setting the symbol and timeframe.

## Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick of the market. In this function, the EA checks if there is an open position. If there is an open position, it checks if the position is in profit. If the position is in profit, the EA closes the position and prints a message. If there is no open position, the EA checks if there is a silver bullet signal. If a signal is detected, the EA opens a new position and prints a message.

## Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is called during the deinitialization of the EA. In this function, the resources used by the trade and series modules are cleaned up.

## Custom Indicator

The `iSilverBullet()` function is a placeholder for the custom indicator logic. You need to implement the actual logic for the silver bullet indicator in this function.
